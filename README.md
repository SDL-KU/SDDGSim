# SDDGSim
Spatial Data Dependence Graph for CNN Accelerators (SDDGSim): \
\
This is a pre-RTL accelerator simulator that models a specific CNN dataflow under given memory constraints. Specifically, the simulator uses a spatial data dependence graph (SDDG) to exploit spatial information, such as which ALU/register each of the instructions involves (e.g., which register location the incoming pixel is loaded into). The simulator also makes it possible to evaluate the impact of the memory constraints imposed by memory block constraints in the memory hierarchy. In order to maximize performance as well as operational correctness, the pre-RTL simulator assumes a latency- and bandwidth-insensitive controller for each PE. It was validated against the Eyeriss implementations, showing that the estimation error is less than 7%
